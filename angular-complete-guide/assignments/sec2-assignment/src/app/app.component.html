  Add A button which says 'Display Details' <br>
Add a paragraph with any content of your choice (e.g. 'Secret Password = tuna') <br>
Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button created in the first step <br>
Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (maybe log a timestamp or simply an incrementing number) <br>
Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (ngClass)
